# God Wallet 
The principle is to let God throw the sieve 256 times, each time with 0 and 1, and get 256 values ‚Äã‚Äãas the result, which determine the final private key. The original intention of designing the God wallet is to protect the safety of everyone's or your own funds. It is better to entrust the funds to God for safekeeping than to entrust the funds to others. Other people's platforms may go bankrupt and run away, but God is eternal.

# God Flipping a Coin (Code Simulation):

1. God's Tool: God uses a super-advanced "random number generator" (in our code, rand_s on Windows, and /dev/urandom on Linux/macOS). This generator produces a sequence of numbers that appear to be completely patternless.

2. The Two Sides of the Coin: We use the digit '0' to represent the tails side of the coin, and the digit '1' to represent the heads side.

3. The Coin-Flipping Process:

-  God takes a number from the "random number generator."

-  God only looks at the last digit of this number (the least significant bit in binary).

-  If the last digit is '1', God records "heads" ('1').

-  If the last digit is '0', God records "tails" ('0').

4. Repeated Flips: God repeats this process many times, each time taking a new number from the "random number generator" and recording either "heads" or "tails."

# Principles:

1. Uniformity of the Random Number Generator: The numbers produced by that "super-advanced random number generator" have an equal chance of having '0' or '1' as their last digit. This is like an ideal coin, where heads and tails have an equal probability of 1/2.

2. Independence: Each time God takes a new number, it has no relationship to the previous numbers. This is like each coin flip being independent; the previous flip doesn't influence the current flip. Just because the last flip was heads doesn't make the next flip more likely to be tails.

3. Binary Representation: We use '0' and '1' to represent the two sides of the coin because computers internally process information in binary. Looking only at the last digit of the random number is equivalent to caring only about whether the random number is odd or even.

# In Simple Terms:

The "God flipping a coin" simulation in this code uses a very powerful "random number generator" within the computer to ensure that each coin flip (generating a '0' or '1') has an equal chance, and that each flip is independent. The resulting string of 0s and 1s is like a record of God's coin flips.


Compile the code:
```sh
gcc -O3 -o god god.c sha256.c base58.c bech32.c ripemd160.c secp256k1.c cashaddr.c random.c sha3256.c keccak256.c
```

or
```sh
make
```

# üöÄ Usage
After successful compilation, you can run the tool from the command line and pass the private key (in hex or WIF format), or let God give you a private key, as a parameter:

```sh

./god

```
# Example
If you have a private key, please enter the hexadecimal private key
```sh

./god 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
./god KwDiBf89QgGbjEhKnhXJuH7LrciVrZi3qYjgd9M7rFU73sVHnoWn
./god 1
```
Output:
```sh
./god
